These are the prompts and qrels used for the experiments in Thomas et al., "System Comparison using Automated Generation
of Relevance Judgements in Multiple Languages", SIGIR 2025.

The *jinja2 files are the prompts (two sets of instructions times four languages, *except* v2 in Chinese for which we
did not have translator availability). These were filled in with the (maybe translated) queries and documents, and fed
to GPT4o (2024-05-13). The qrels files from the parsed output are in *qrels.

Each file is named for the year (e.g. "neuclir24"), prompt version and language (e.g. "news1zh"), document language
("rudocs"), and topic/query language ("entopics").
